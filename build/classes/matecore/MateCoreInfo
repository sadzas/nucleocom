// --- LADO CLIENTE => Error codes
0–999	Reserved and not used.
1000        CLOSE_NORMAL                Normal closure; the connection successfully completed whatever purpose for which it was created.
1001        CLOSE_GOING_AWAY            The endpoint is going away, either because of a server failure or because the browser is navigating away from the page that opened the connection.
1002        CLOSE_PROTOCOL_ERROR	The endpoint is terminating the connection due to a protocol error.
1003        CLOSE_UNSUPPORTED           The connection is being terminated because the endpoint received data of a type it cannot accept (for example, a text-only endpoint received binary data).
1004        Reserved.                   A meaning might be defined in the future.
1005        CLOSE_NO_STATUS             Reserved.  Indicates that no status code was provided even though one was expected.
1006        CLOSE_ABNORMAL              Reserved. Used to indicate that a connection was closed abnormally (that is, with no close frame being sent) when a status code is expected.
1007        Unsupported Data            The endpoint is terminating the connection because a message was received that contained inconsistent data (e.g., non-UTF-8 data within a text message).
1008        Policy Violation            The endpoint is terminating the connection because it received a message that violates its policy. This is a generic status code, used when codes 1003 and 1009 are not suitable.
1009        CLOSE_TOO_LARGE             The endpoint is terminating the connection because a data frame was received that is too large.
1010        Missing Extension           The client is terminating the connection because it expected the server to negotiate one or more extension, but the server didn't.
1011        Internal Error              The server is terminating the connection because it encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
1012        Service Restart             The server is terminating the connection because it is restarting. [Ref]
1013        Try Again Later             The server is terminating the connection due to a temporary condition, e.g. it is overloaded and is casting off some of its clients. [Ref]
1014        Reserved for future use by the WebSocket standard.
1015        TLS Handshake               Reserved. Indicates that the connection was closed due to a failure to perform a TLS handshake (e.g., the server certificate can't be verified).
1016–1999   Reserved for future use by the WebSocket standard.
2000–2999   Reserved for use by WebSocket extensions.
3000–3999   Available for use by libraries and frameworks. May not be used by applications. Available for registration at the IANA via first-come, first-serve.
4000–4999   Available for use by applications.
